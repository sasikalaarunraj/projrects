<th>Title:</th><td>Generic algorithm for analyzing the handgesture</td>

<tr>
<th>Environment:</th><td>Digital image processing</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Description:</th><td>Service robots directly interact with people, so finding a more natural and easier user interface is of fundamental importance. In this paper we implemented a system through which the user can give commands to a wireless robot using gestures. Through this method, the user can control or navigate the robot by using gestures of his/her palm, thereby interacting with the robotic system. The command signals are generated from these gestures using image processing. These signals are then passed to the robot to navigate it in the specified directions.</td>
